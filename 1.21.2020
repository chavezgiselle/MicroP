#Switch Bounce
	-It is the glitches before and after the wave form is made. This gets worse as the switches age. The material oxidizes and when you release weird glitching pattern
	-Data sheet on switch will tell you how long is it expected to have switch bounce

#Time

	-Three versions, default is seconds
	-To wait milliseconds: wait_ms(25)
